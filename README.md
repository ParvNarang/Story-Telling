# Story-Telling
Story telling using Python
In this project the computer asks the user which story/song he/she wants to listen to, that uses speech_recognition library for recognising the things the user says and plays the sound located in the device using the playsound library.
After the story is played, the user can also ask questions related to the story. Initially the program has 2 stories and a song section.

# FUTUREPLAN
To use a RaspberryPi and fit it in a box which is portable and runs the stories.
