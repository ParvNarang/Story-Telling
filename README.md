# Story-Telling
Story telling using Python.
In this project the device asks the user which story/song he/she wants to listen to, that uses speech_recognition library for recognising the things the user says and plays the story/song located in the device(in .mp3 format) using the playsound library.
After the story is played, the user can also ask questions related to the story. Initially the program has 2 stories and a song section.

# FUTUREPLAN
To use a RaspberryPi and fit it in a box which is portable and runs the stories.
